# SURE_Project_Master1

## Description
This project was made by another student and myself during our first year of our Master of Science degree, we were provided with this problem "every packet is sent one by one but each one of them has a 20% to drop, our goal was to create a SURE protocol for reliable data transfer." 

## Installation
Use the "make" command to build the project and run it.

## Usage
You need to start receive_file in a terminal and then launch copy_file *name of file* in another terminal, you can use the file "entier.txt" to try our protocol.

## Support
If you need any help contact me at hamza.chablaoui@etu.u-bordeaux.fr
